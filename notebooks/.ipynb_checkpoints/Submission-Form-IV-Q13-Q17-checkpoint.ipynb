    "In Dr Dawson’s seminar, she discussed her educational and career paths, and how she uses programming and mathematics in her line of work. Initially, she completed a Bachelor of Mechatronics at QUT. Although her undergraduate studies did not focus specifically on mathematics and software use, she uses such tools heavily. She has gained on-the-job experience in cloud computing, Julia, Python, MATLAB and C++, among others.\n",

    "After completing her undergraduate studies, she undertook an internship at CSIRO, during which she worked to develop an autonomous vision-based target detection system for an underwater vehicle.  A key point she made was that the language that’s best for writing in may not be the best language for actually executing the program; languages that are easy to code in may take longer to execute than less-intuitive languages. However, she said that Julia is appealing because it can be both easy to use and easily implemented. Knowing that Julia is actually a key tool used in research and industry does make the difficulty of this course feel worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following her work at CSIRO, she completed a PhD at UQ, which focused on statistical analysis of orientation and TDOA-based geolocation estimation – in doing this, she had to answer key questions about how position estimates are generated, such as how predictors perform in different situations, if a solution can be generated and how accurate this solution is. After completing her PhD, she worked at multiple positions, including for Shell, Origin Energy and Boeing.\n",

    "Dr Dawson currently works at Fugro, a leading company in the energy, infrastructure and water markets. In this position, she works as a team lead in Fugro Roames, which assesses and monitors powerline infrastructure over a large area for clients. Her team is responsible for taking the data gathered via LIDAR and autonomously classifying the physical structures, which creates a 3D image of the area. A key point I picked up is that a significant part of many of her jobs is being able to predict and fix complications in a solution she’s created for a given problem. For example, she and her team at Fugro need to be able to identify and deal with the risks and uncertainties associated with taking a single LIDAR scan of an area that may change over time. As I continue in my studies and career, I think it will be useful to remember that coming up with a solution – whether it be programmatic or mathematic in nature – is only the first step in solving real-world problems. In reality, much more work is done in fixing things as they break and improving on existing solutions.\n"
